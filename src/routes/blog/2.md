## Hallo

I initially wrote this file to test out the capabilities of mdsvex but I thought I could also write some more.

I have been thinking the following while working on this website.

> Why is it hard to make your own website?

Immediately I realized some obvious reasons.
- It should display who you are to the public and this can be very overwhelming for a lot of people
- Webdevelopment is such a vast area with a lot to learn, which can also be overwhelming
- It involves creating designs, which is another thing that has a whole field for it

Concerning the software design I am still not sure if I would want to proceed with the setup I currently have. Which is posting new posts through git commits. 

I also am writing the tailwindcss inside the markdown files because I don't know how else I would update the layout of the post. This adds extra effort to writing the posts alone but I guess it allows for certain flexibility when I want certain elements to look a certain way.


<style lang="postcss">
    blockquote {
        @apply dark:bg-slate-800 bg-gray-50 p-2 mt-2 mb-4 mx-4
    }

    ul {
        @apply flex flex-col
    }

    li {
        @apply my-2 mx-6 font-thin list-disc
    }

    h2 {
		@apply pb-4;
	}
    
    p {
        @apply py-2
    }

    a {
        @apply text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-400 dark:text-blue-500 dark:hover:text-blue-200
    }
    </style>
