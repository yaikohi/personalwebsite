## Gutentag

I installed mdsvex to handle markdown files for me as I plan to write my blogs in markdown language.

Not really one-hundred percent sure. However, figuring out how to get mdsvex to work with my application is interesting enough in itself so I thought why not.

I followed [John's](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) blogpost about setting up mdsvex and sveltekit to set it up for my own website. It was a good informative read.

Working on this website I also maintained a list of sources which can be found on the github page of this website [here](https://github.com/yaikohi/personalwebsite).

<style lang="postcss">
	h2 {
		@apply pb-4;
	}
    
    p {
        @apply py-2 last:pt-36;
    }

    a {
        @apply text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-400 dark:text-blue-500 dark:hover:text-blue-200
    }
</style>
