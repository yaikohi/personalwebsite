5. Typescript giving me an error about not finding a module a week after developing this application for some reason. [svelte-preprocess](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess) Solved by adding `preprocess.typescript: true` inside of the `svelte.config.js`. Actually didn't fix anything nevermind lol.
